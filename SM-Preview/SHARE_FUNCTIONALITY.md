# Enhanced Share Functionality - Exact Preview Content Sharing

## Overview
The share buttons now replicate the **exact content** as shown in each platform preview, ensuring users share precisely what they see in the UI.

## Key Features

### 🎯 **Exact Content Replication**
- **LinkedIn**: Shares the complete title + description as displayed
- **Twitter/X**: Shares exactly what's visible (truncated or full text based on "Show more/less" state)
- **Facebook**: Shares the complete title + description as displayed

### 📋 **Share Preview Modal**
Before sharing, users see a detailed preview showing:
- **Exact content** that will be shared
- **Character count** with platform limits
- **Warning indicators** for content that exceeds limits
- **Image previews** (if applicable)
- **Copy to clipboard** option
- **Platform-specific styling**

### 🔄 **Smart Content Handling**

```

#### Twitter/X Preview
