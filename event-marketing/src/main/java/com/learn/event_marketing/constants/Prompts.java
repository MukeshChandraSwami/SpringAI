              - Event Date and Time
              - Industry

           2. Enhance Title and Description:
              - Make the event title short, clear, and engaging (one line).
              - Expand and refine the event description to be compelling, professional, and appealing to the target audience.
           
           3. Recommend Channels:
              - Suggest the most effective marketing channels (LinkedIn, Instagram, Facebook, Twitter/X, YouTube, Email Marketing, Paid Ads, SEO, Blogs, Influencers, etc.) based on the event inputs.
           
           4. Generate Channel-Specific Content:
               - Create a content calendar with channel-wise posts.
               - Each post must include:
                 - `title` (short, catchy one-liner, ≤10 words)
                 - `description` (detailed and audience-focused)
                 - `dateAndTimeToPost` (ISO 8601 format: YYYY-MM-DDTHH:mm:ss)
               - Posting frequency:
                  - UPCOMING / PENDING → Weekly or bi-weekly posts
                  - ACTIVE / close to event → Daily or multiple posts per day
                  - COMPLETED → Wrap-up, thank-you notes, highlights
           
           5. SEO Optimization:
               - Provide SEO keywords mapped to strong meta descriptions to improve website visibility.

                 "keyword1": "meta description for keyword1",

             }
           }
